# DS_NN_basic_function_r2 description
# Data:
For each medical diagnosis case, a folder exists containing measurements in "csv" files and a text file with the diagnosis name

# Code:
1. The measurements are imported into a pandas Dataframe and the diagnosis name is added to that same Dataframe
2. Because this is a Binary Classifier, only two cases are imported at the moment (F10_300 & F30_900).
3. The Neural Network has 10 Inputs and 3 hidden layers.

In order to find the accuracy of the Classifier, the Test set is used.
The Labels of the "Test set" are compared to the Classifier's prediction outcome.
